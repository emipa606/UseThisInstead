**TLDR: This mod scans your installed mods and suggest working/more updated replacements for those mods**

Continuations of mods has many names and has become an large part of the RimWorld modding community.
It can be hard to keep track of when mods gets a new version by another modder. This mod tries to remedy that by keeping track and informing about when a mod has a replacement version on the workshop. 

Data from my own [collection](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1541984105) of continued mods is a large part of this mod. Another large part is from my friends continuations; the [collection](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=2787987321) by [Zaljerem](https://steamcommunity.com/id/zaljerem) and the [collection](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=2099979037) by [velcroboy333](https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198032065507). 
The mod also uses info about mods that have been requested on my Discord server and continued by another modder as well as any mod published on the workshop using the usual suffixes for continued mods (as seen in the preview image).

This mod should work well together with my [Show Mod Updates](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3218690663) to make it easier to keep track of you favorite mods during those major RimWorld updates!

This mod will be updated regularly to include new releases. I hope this will be of use and if you have info about a mod-continuation not showing up in the mod or a faulty replacement suggestion, please report it in the comments or on the linked Discord-server.

**Note: for those using non-steam download like rimpy with steamcmd, apparently that solution does not reliably remove files when updating. So if you have a problem with old replacement showing up, try removing the mod fully between each update.**
